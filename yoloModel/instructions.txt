1. split the data into training, validation and testing in the following ratio : 80%, 13%, 7% (respectively).
	- make sure to save the right labels to their images (its super 			 important), u can do that by checking the similar file names between the images and labels folder.
2. make sure to have the following folder structure:
 	data folder => it got two folders inside (images & labels), yaml file.
 	images folder => training images , val images, testing images.
 	labels folder => training labels, val labels, testing labels. 
3. load the data to your google drive, make sure u got at least 5GB free space in your drive storage.
4. edit the yaml file with the drive paths of the mentioned files in the yaml file associated, dont change anything else in the yaml file except the paths.
5. when you load the colab notebook, dont forget to change any required paths.
5. train the model.
